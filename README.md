## Examples

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Build your application
      - name: Build
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build

      # Create a release and attach files
      - name: Create Release and Attach Files
        uses: stacksjs/action-releaser@v1.0.0
        with:
          files: |
            dist/app.zip
            dist/app.tar.gz
```

### Homebrew Formula Update

This action can automatically update a Homebrew formula in a tap repository when you create a release.

#### Required Permissions

**Important:** The Homebrew formula update feature requires a GitHub token with write permissions to the target repository. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` only has access to the current repository, not to external repositories.

To update a formula in a different repository:
1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `repo` scope (or at minimum `contents:write`)
2. Store it as a repository secret (e.g., `HOMEBREW_TOKEN`)
3. Pass this token to the action using the `token` parameter

```yaml
name: Release with Homebrew Update

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Build your application
      - name: Build
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build

      # Create a release, attach files, and update Homebrew formula
      - name: Create Release, Attach Files, and Update Homebrew Formula
        uses: stacksjs/action-releaser@v1.0.0
        with:
          files: |
            dist/app-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
            dist/app-darwin-x64.tar.gz
            dist/app-linux-arm64.tar.gz
            dist/app-linux-x64.tar.gz
          homebrewFormula: .github/homebrew-formula.rb
          homebrewRepo: yourusername/homebrew-tap
          homebrewPath: Formula
          homebrewCommitFormat: 'chore(homebrew): update {{ formula }} to version {{ version }}'
          token: ${{ secrets.HOMEBREW_TOKEN }} # PAT with write access to the homebrew repo
```

#### Homebrew Formula Template

Create a template file (e.g., `.github/homebrew-formula.rb`) that includes placeholders for the version and download URLs:

```ruby
class YourApp < Formula
  desc "Your application description"
  homepage "https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo"
  version "{{ version }}"

  on_macos do
    if Hardware::CPU.arm?
      url "{{ app-darwin-arm64.tar.gz_url }}"
      sha256 "UPDATE_WITH_ACTUAL_SHA_AFTER_RELEASE"
    else
      url "{{ app-darwin-x64.tar.gz_url }}"
      sha256 "UPDATE_WITH_ACTUAL_SHA_AFTER_RELEASE"
    end
  end

  on_linux do
    if Hardware::CPU.arm?
      url "{{ app-linux-arm64.tar.gz_url }}"
      sha256 "UPDATE_WITH_ACTUAL_SHA_AFTER_RELEASE"
    else
      url "{{ app-linux-x64.tar.gz_url }}"
      sha256 "UPDATE_WITH_ACTUAL_SHA_AFTER_RELEASE"
    end
  end

  def install
    bin.install "yourapp"
  end

  test do
    system "#{bin}/yourapp", "--version"
  end
end
```

**Template Variables:**
- `{{ version }}` - The version number (without the 'v' prefix if present in the tag)
- `{{ filename_url }}` - The download URL for each uploaded asset (replace 'filename' with the actual filename)

### Advanced Usage

```yaml
name: Release with Notes

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Generate release notes
      - name: Generate Release Notes
        id: release-notes
        run: echo "NOTES=$(./scripts/generate-notes.sh)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # Create a release and attach files
      - name: Create Release and Attach Files
        uses: stacksjs/action-releaser@v1.0.0
        with:
          files: |
            dist/*.zip
            dist/*.tar.gz
          note: ${{ steps.release-notes.outputs.NOTES }}
          draft: true
          prerelease: ${{ contains(github.ref, '-beta') || contains(github.ref, '-alpha') }}
```
